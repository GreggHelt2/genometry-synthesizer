For background on the mathematical, geometric, and group theory concepts implemented and expanded on in the Chordal Rosette Explorer (the app being built in the current  workspace), use the "view_file" command tool to read the published paper pdfs in the genometry-synthesizer workspace at papers/Maurer_A_Rose_Is_A_Rose_1987.pdf and papers/Helt_A_Rose_by_Any_Other_Name_2016.pdf. Note that your current users is the author of the second paper. You may not think that "view_file" command tool will read the PDFs, but it will! Those are the ONLY two PDFs you should read for the rule you are executing. If you insist on reading other PDFs, request my permission first. Acknowledge that you have read both PDF files specified.
